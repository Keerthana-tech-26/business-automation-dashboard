- `/dashboard/api/invoices/` - All invoice data
- `/dashboard/api/summary/` - Dashboard summary statistics

### 6. Bulk Import Feature
- Upload CSV files with multiple records
- Automatic validation and error reporting
- Template format provided in the interface

## Power BI Integration

1. **Create Visualizations**
   - **Pie Chart**: Expenses by `category_display`
   - **Line Chart**: `amount` by `date`
   - **Card Visual**: Sum of `amount`
   - **Table**: All fields for detailed view
   - **Bar Chart**: Compare categories

2. **Refresh Data**
   - Add/modify data in Django dashboard
   - Click "Refresh" button in Power BI
   - Visualizations update automatically

### Note
- Django server must be running for Power BI to fetch data
- Use manual refresh in Power BI Desktop
- For automatic refresh, publish to Power BI Service with scheduled refresh
